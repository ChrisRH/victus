Ponderings and thoughts about our hidden life within - that I believe will continue on forever.

I have often considered how the physical universe goes on infinitium.  As a young child camping with my late father under the stars, I mentioned how is it that the universe goes on forever?  He said quite matter-of-factly, you don't think about such things.  My children said, it must end, when I've brought it up in general conversation; to which I say, what's after the end if it ends?  There must be something - empty space itself is something.

In like manner I have often pondered on how our conscience life, thoughts and emotions continue on forever.  I strongly believe our inner life, that 'self' inside us, continues on forever like the universe; but in what state?
