Ponderings and thoughts about our hidden life within - that I believe will continue on forever.

I have often considered how the physical universe goes on infinitium.  As a young child camping with my late father under the stars, I mentioned how is it that the universe goes on forever?  He said quite matter-of-factly, you don't think about such things.  My children said, it must end, when I've brought it up in general conversation; to which I say, what's after the end if it ends?  There must be something - empty space itself is something.

In like manner I have often pondered on how our conscience life, thoughts and emotions etc, continue on forever.  I strongly believe our inner life, that 'self' inside us, continues on forever like the universe; but in what state and where?  I have read many beliefs and heard many explanations regarding this matter.  From those who believe we just sleep and that it after death - no conscientiousness, to re-births until you are released into the higher planes of existence, onto others who believe they will be like Adam and Eve and populate another planet if they do good in this life. 

I personally hold to the faith and teachings of the Jewish and Christian Scriptures, otherwise known as the Bible.  Though I don't fully comprehend what life would be like after we leave this physical life (after death).
